This articles documents some terminologies and definitions in finance that people from computer science background usually are not familiar with. 
### Alpha, delta, and theta 
### Derivative definition, types and usage
Derivatives in finance simply means a contract between buyers and sellers. Common types of derivatives include future/forward, options, and swaps. Derivatives can be used in gambling/speculation, hedging, abitrage and solutions. Gambling/speculation indicates that traders are gambiling on the rising or falling or prices whereas hedging means that the trader is worrying that the profolio is falling in value. 

#### Future contracts
Future contract is a contract between two parties based on the price agreed upon currently but with a due date in the future. Forward contract is more like a non-standardized future contract. 


#### Options
##### Call option and put options
Call option is the right for buyer to buy some assets whereas put option is the right for seller to get rid of assets. The buyer of the call option has the right but not the obligation to buy certain amount of assets at a fixed price called strike price. When the buyer of the call options wants to exercise the contract, the seller has the obligation to sell. 

For example, one seller sells the following call options:
> the right to buy 1000 shares of stock A at price 1 dollar per share in the next 3 months. 


On the contrary, the buyer of the put option has the right but not the obligation to sell certain amount of assets at strike price. When buyer wants to exercise the contract, the seller will have the obligation to buy it.  

For example, one seller sells the following put options:
> the right to sell 1000 shares of stock A at price 1 dollar per share in the next 3 months. 

##### Strike price 
The strike price is a fixed price that is written in the call options are put options. Strike price has nothing to do with the market price. In fact, buyers who buy call options are hoping the market price will go up and then make a profit by buying the stock through strike price, whereas sellers who sell put options are hoping the stock price will go down. 

##### American style and European style

In the case that the profolio is falling in value, one option is to sell the profolio which might incur tax. Another option would be buy a put option.

#### Swap
