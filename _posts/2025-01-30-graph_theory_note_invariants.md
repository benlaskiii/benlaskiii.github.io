Induced graph: $$ G=(V,E), G^{'} $$ is a subgraph of G and an induced graph iff for any $$ x,y\in V^{'}$$, the corresponding edge $$(x,y) \in G^{'}$$.

$$\delta(G)$$: the minimum degree of G

$$ \Delta(G) $$: the maximum degree of G

$$d(G)$$: the average degree of G

$$\mathcal{E}(G)$$: edges per vertexï¼š$$\mathcal{E}(G) = \frac{1}{2}d(G)$$ 

$$g(G)$$: girth, the least length of cycle in G

cirmumceference: length of the longest cycle in G
