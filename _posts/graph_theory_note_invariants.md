Induced graph: $G=(V,E), G^{'} $ is a subgraph of G and an induced graph iff for any $ x,y\in V^{'}$, the corresponding edge $(x,y) \in G^{'} $.

$\delta$(G): the minimum degree of G

$\Delta(G)$: the maximum degree of G

$d(G)$: the average degree of G

$\mathcal{E}(G)$: edges per vertex 

$\mathcal{E}(G) = \frac{1}{2}d(G)$ 

$g(G)$: girth, the least length of cycle in G

cirmumceference: length of the longest cycle in G
